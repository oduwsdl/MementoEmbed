Welcome to the MementoEmbed project!

* **Ensure that this bug was not already reported** by searching our GitHub issues.

* If you do not find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be clear about what caused the issue. At a minimum, provide the URI-Ms attempted. If possible, provide the approximate date and time of execution, and any output or screenshots.

**Did you write a patch that fixes the bug?**

Thank you for your proposed contribution.

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure that the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Map the PR to an issue number, if applicable.

**Did you write a patch that provides a feature?**

Thank you for your proposed contribution.

* Ensure that the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Map the PR to an issue number, if applicable.

We will consider all feature requests (especially those with a PR). We apologize in advance if your contribution is not accepted. We are prioritizing bug fixes over requested features at the current time.

**Did you fix whitespace, format code, or suggest a purely cosmetic patch?**

Cosmetic changes that do not add anything substantial to the execution of MementoEmbed will generally not be accepted. Our currently focus for MementoEmbed is functionality. It takes a lot of work and contributions by the community to ensure that more than 20 years of archived web pages can be represented cleanly.

**Do you have questions about the source code or the project in general?**
